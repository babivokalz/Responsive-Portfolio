          Hello and welcome to my page! As you can tell, my name is Wendy. I
          currently work in Quality Assurance at a Biopharmaceutilcal company in
          RTP. I have a 3 year old Golden Retriever named Bailey who loves to
          play fetch. I was born and raised in Boston, Massachusetts (Go
          Pats/Celtics/Red Sox/Bruins!) so it was really eye-opening when I
          first moved to North Carolina. Prior to my move to NC, I lived and
          worked in Copenhagen, Denmark. My company sent me there for a
          temporary work assignment and it was definitely the most memorable and best
          experience I've ever had; it was amazing to be able to immerse myself in a totally different country and culture. 
          <p>I'm an amateur foodie so I really miss all
          the yummy food in Boston. One thing that I don't think I'll ever get
          used to is the humidity... especially the summer time! It's unbearable
          to be outside - even for my outdoor loving pupper.
          In my free time I like to play video games (mostly PC, or Nintendo
          Switch), experiment with different food recipies with my boyfriend,
          and I love to travel! I also love going to EDM events and festivals
          with my friends from Boston.
